ICArUS Challenge Problem Software and Data - README

This project contains all Test & Evaluation software developed to support Phases 1 and 2 of 
the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity ICArUS program, as well as human 
behavioral data collected in Phases 1 and 2. Please refer to the document "Integrated 
Cognitive-neuroscience Architectures for Understanding Sensemaking (ICArUS): 
Overview of Test and Evaluation Materials" (approved for public release with unlimited distribution, 
Case # 14-4159) for a description of the software and data. 

This software and data is provided strictly to support demonstrations of ICArUS challenge problems
 and to assist in the development of cognitive-neuroscience architectures. It is not intended to be used
in operational systems or environments.

The desktop version of the Test & Evaluation GUI is in the distrib/Icarus_TE_Application folder. 
Launch the application by double-clicking the file "Icarus_TE_GUI.jar". 
You must have a Java JRE 1.7 or higher installed to use the software.

The NetBeans IDE was used to develop this software, and it may be opened as a NetBeans project.
